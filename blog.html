                                <p> &emsp; &emsp;<strong>B</strong>ack around October 2014 I made a huge life decision, and I wasn't really sure if it was the right choice to make or not. At this point, I was about to hit my 10 year mark in the Marines working
                                    logistics. After talking it over with my wife, I decided to get out honorably and start the next phase of my life. Well let me tell you, the next phase sucked BALLS!! I couldn't collect unemployement for various reasons,
                                    I ended up getting disability through the VA but they weren't going to be able to start paying me until September of 2016 (I got out Feb 2015). I got severance pay when I left but after taxes it was about a quarter
                                    of what I made in a year. I applied for logistics jobs every where within 100 miles of me, they only wanted to hire me at around $9 truck driving or moving peoples stuff. Most didn't even bother to call me back. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Eventually
                                    when my money was all but gone I reluctantly took a job working at the same company as my wife as an air plane manufacturing mechanic making slightly over $13 an hour. Though I wasn't a fan of the job it, gave me some
                                    experience in a field I knew nothing about. After a year I was promoted to quality inspector (my current job). I started thinking to myself that toughing it out in College for an engineering degree that would put me
                                    in some debt would be the only option. I went to <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org" title="khan Academy">Khan Academy</a> and started catching up on my math since I knew it would include things like Calc and other
                                    stuff I've forgotten. Turns out, I had to start over all the way from 5th grade math because though there was a lot that came back to me, there was so much that I forgot that I felt borderline stupid. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;
                                    At this point I started talking to a friend of mine that I've known for the last 15 years and he tells me he's doing web developement. by this point I was on 10th grade math and jumping between trying to learn C++ (hated
                                    it), and Python (hated it) through books and YouTube videos by
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston" title="Bucky Roberts">The New Boston</a>. To my surprise, my friend who had his CS degree actually told me not to go to College (controversial opinion, I know), he
                                    suggested I do something else instead that was lot cheaper (free actually) and would let me know if this was the right path for me. He told me to go to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com" title="Free Code Camp">Free Code Camp</a>                                    and give it a shot.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp; The next day I made an account and figured Id play with this for about an hour then do something else. So that hour turned into a week, that week turned into a month and so on.
                                    I did HTML and CSS on freecode camp for a while, even completed a few shitty looking projects that I was extremely proud of. Loading them up now makes me want to shut my computer off and walk away in shame. Meanwhile,
                                    my friend didn't want to give me any other materials to checkout due to the fact that most people who ask how to become a web Developer usually end up quitting around this time. TO his surprise however, 3 months later
                                    I was still around and finished the Basic front end dev course on FCC. At this point I went online and watched a few "how to become a Front End Developer" videos, read all the blogs I could and even started listening
                                    to podcast. I'll list some of my favorite podcast to check out if you get a chance.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp; Start Here PodCast - Dain Miller<br><br>&emsp;&emsp; Syntax - Wes Bos and Scott Tolinki<br><br>&emsp;&emsp; Full
                                    Stack JavaScript Podcast - Dario Cantatore <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Simple Programmer - John Sonmez<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;I hightly recommend them if you get a chance. On the 4th Month I decided to take a deep dive into JavaScript,
                                    I honestly was not getting the stuff that FCC was teaching me on JQuery and felt like they were just going through random motions but did not cover any eccentials that I needed to do anything on my own. I was looking
                                    through different sources for JavaScript learning starting with a Udemy course called
                                    <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">The Web Developer Boot Camp by Colt Steele</a>. Possibly the coolest name in Web Developement I think. This course was good but I felt like it was a bit too
                                    fast pase or advanced for me. I realized this when I decide to embark on my own project and sat there with a blank text editor not know how to even start a function. I honestly almost gave up and felt like a lot of
                                    my effort was going to go down the drain until I decided to try out <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com" title="Team Treehouse">Team TreeHouse</a> as a last effort. I'll post next time to let you know how it has
                                    gone so far for me along with a few things I learned a long the way that might help a beginner not feel so lost.</p>
