                            <p> &emsp; &emsp;<strong>B</strong>ack around October 2014 I made a huge life decision, and I wasn't really sure if it was the right choice to make or not. At this point, I was nearing 10 years in the Marines working logistics
                                and distribution. I loved what I did and enjoyed being a Marine but I felt it was time try new things. This however, didn't go well for about a year. I had this idea that my military experience would amount to more than
                                minimum wage (I was wrong haha). As my savings started draining I decided to take an airplane mechanic entry level job at around $14 an hour. After a year I was promoted to quality inspector (my current job). <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;
                                I began looking into giving college another shot as the mundane feeling began to set in from work. I started talking to a friend of mine that I've known for the last 15 years and he tells me he's doing web development.
                                To be perfectly honest I had no clue what Web Development even consisted of at the time. I never really gave it much thought as to how websites would randomly show up, who worked them, and what it took to put one together.
                                I started looking up information, anything I could find from articles, to videos and job market statistics. If you ever want to feel overwhelmed, Google search what it takes to become a Front End Developer. You'll see a
                                huge list of things that <em>"EVERY"</em> developer <strong>MUST</strong> know. Once my freaking out settled down, I asked my friend where I should start. He's been asked this question many times before, gladly gives up
                                the information and would watch people fall off before the first month is over.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp; He pointed me to FreeCodeCamp and told me to do the entire front end course and if I was still around after that he would
                                tell me what to do next. I started back in November 3rd and got a majority of the front end completed, I enjoyed the challenges and constant learning. I could only do it for a few hours while at home as I still had a full
                                time job so I looked up other resourses to train my brain to think like a dev. I was really into podcasts while at work so I looked up a few this subject, turns out there are some pretty cool ones that you can check, here
                                are a few of my favorites.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp; Start Here PodCast - Dain Miller<br><br>&emsp;&emsp; Syntax - Wes Bos and Scott Tolinki<br><br>&emsp;&emsp; Full Stack JavaScript Podcast - Dario Cantatore <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Simple
                                Programmer - John Sonmez<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;I hightly recommend them if you get a chance. I find that listening to conversations about programming, even if you don't understand what they're talking about can help you pick
                                up on keywords and technologies. I looked up a few things they would mention that FCC didn't talk about like editors, libraries and frameworks. On the 4th Month I decided to take a deep dive into JavaScript, I honestly
                                was not getting the stuff that FCC was teaching me on JQuery and felt like they were just going through random motions but did not cover any eccentials that I needed to do anything on my own. I was looking through different
                                sources for JavaScript learning starting with a Udemy course called
                                <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">The Web Developer Boot Camp by Colt Steele</a>. Possibly the coolest name in Web Development I think. This course was good but I felt like it was a bit too fast
                                pace or advanced for me. I realized this when I decide to embark on my own project and sat there with a blank text editor not know how to even start a function. I honestly almost gave up and felt like a lot of my effort
                                was going to go down the drain until I decided to try out <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com" title="Team Treehouse">Team TreeHouse</a> as a last effort. I'll post next time to let you know how it has gone so far for
                                me along with a few things I learned a long the way that might help a beginner not feel so lost.
